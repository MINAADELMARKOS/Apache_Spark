## 🎯 Why This Series Exists

Most Spark content falls into one of two traps:
1. **Too academic** — good theory, zero production realism  
2. **Too shallow** — code snippets without understanding trade-offs  

**Spark Explained** exists to fix that.

This series:
- Explains Spark **clearly** for beginners  
- Challenges misconceptions for experienced engineers  
- Highlights **what goes wrong in real systems** — and how to fix it  
- Adds production context from **telecom, banking, and regulated environments**

All content is adapted from *Spark: The Definitive Guide* — but **validated against real-world usage**.
